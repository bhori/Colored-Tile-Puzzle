# Colored-Tile-Puzzle
This project implements number of search algorithms which designed to solve the Colored-Tile-Puzzle game.  
The algorithms used to solve the game are BFS, DFID, A*, IDA* and DFBnB.  
This project uses Strategy design pattern.  
Look at [project instructions](https://github.com/bhori/Colored-Tile-Puzzle/blob/master/Project%20instructions.pdf) to understand the game and the project guidelines.
