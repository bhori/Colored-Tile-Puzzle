# Colored-Tile-Puzzle
This project implements number of search algorithms which designed to solve the game Colored-Tile-Puzzle.  
The algorithms used to solve the game are BFS, DFID, A*, IDA* and DFBnB.  
This project uses Strategy design pattern.  
Look at "Project instruction.pdf" file to understand the game and the project instructions.
